# Nothing

This is the first (short) demo created using my own Rust framework, [usch](https://github.com/Kwarf/usch).

The music is made in FL Studio, using primarily the [Vital](https://vital.audio) VST, with a vocal sample
from [season eight episode eight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkKwyjsJGxk&t=37s) of The Simpsons.
